Provides Elliptic Curve based asymmetric encryption and signing.

In particular, shared secrets are straightforward to generate using Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman [ECDH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic-curve_Diffie%E2%80%93Hellman) using `NewSharedSecret` and `RecreateSharedSecret`.

Each party creates a `PrivateKey` using a `Curve` of their choice, then makes their `PublicKey` generally available.  `NewSharedSecret` uses the `PublicKey` of the remote party and a one-time `PrivateKey` to create a shared secret, returning both the one-time key details and the shared secret.  

Passing the corresponding one-time `PublicKey` allows the remote `PrivateKey` owner to also generate the shared secret, which can therefore be used as a symmetric encryption key.

Keys wrap their `ecdsa` equivalents, to add serialisation and simplify signing.  Each `PrivateKey` additionally has a unique `ID` value.

`Signed[T Signable]` is a generic type, constrained by `Signable`, that holds data and its signature, as generated by a `PrivateKey`.  `Signed` stores the `ID` of the signing `PrivateKey` allowing simple `PublicKey` retrieval for verification by other parties.

`Signed` supports serialisation to JSON, using base64 raw std encoding.
